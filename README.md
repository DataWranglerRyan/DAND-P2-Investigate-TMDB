# DAND-P2-Investigate a Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree's second project: Investigate a Dataset.

Movie data was imported from The Movie Database's API and cleaned by a user on Kaggle. This project's goal is to take
this dataset and go through the entire Data Analysis process, from posing a question to data wrangling to visualizing the
data.

For my analysis I wanted to answer the following questions:
1. On average, Do actors and actresses with longer careers produce movies with higher user ratings?
2. On average, Do actors and actresses who have been in more films produce movies with higher user ratings?
3. Which actor/actress was in the most movies, and how did that actor's movie user ratings change over his/her career?

The answers to these questions and explanations on how I reached these answers can be found in *report/DAND Project 2 Investigate TMDB.html*.

I have also provided the Jupyter Notebook that was used to create this report. It can be found in *notebooks/DAND Project 2 Investigate TMDB.ipynb*.
